Where the state has no game

- State (etymology, definition)
  - Also include Sanskrit equivalent
  - Languages are similar?
- Alchemy
- Why this talk?
  - Project Euler problem
  - Solution
- Problem with state
  - Even without concurrency
  - Example using Date and Person birthday
- Most of our tests are lies and can't be used to reason about code
  - 'final' doesn't really help. References can be held
- Extreme solution of making everything immutable
- Sapir Whorf Hypothesis
  - Arrival movie
- Loops
  - Simple for loop has state
  - It also has an implicit condition
  - Immutable world uses recursion to loop
  - State won't be shared between recursive calls
  - Palindrome experiment
  - Changes our approach
  - Terminal conditions first, as opposed to index
-Premature optimisation
  - Knuth
  - What does 'performance' mean?
  - Aren't we willing to take a performance hit in order to express better?
- Functions
  - Can't be more than a single line if there is no mutation
  - Functions tend to be pure
  - Easier to test
  - Easier to reason
  - Possible to compose
- Lazy sequencing
- Add slides for zebrafication, spinners etc
- Can't hoist existing syntax for immutability
  - = is a poor assignment operator for immutability
  - Mixing immutable and mutable constructs make things harder
